# Ideas relatives to the project.

--------------------------------


## Genetic algorithms with the user stats. 
TL;DR
Make it learned how to choose a song.

Use the informations we have in base (who played what when) in a genetic
algorithms. 
Find a way to translate "the best song" as a objective for the generations.
Introduce the generations of data, and how it's able to deal with the data, 
create pools and start run on the data we have several time.
then at each log coming, introduce it more importantly in the algorithm.
Settings should be live changeable, the percentage of mutation per generation,
the size of them and the objective settings.



---------------------------------

##Show user trends/
TL;DR: graph

Display grpahs (as a beginning, then let's see) of listening trends, in time and per song.
This is just a live translation of the database.
The point is to bind directly the action on the front (a hover, a click, whatever) to the 
database. Could be something like:

* user action is triggered 
  * front side send signal through a socket 
  * backend open the channel with db 
    * backend store starting point and size of the initial flow
    * transmit the initial data amount to the front
  * backend emit the first data set, and keep the db connection open.
  * each new data is directly emited by the backend through the table changes.
  * front receive the initial data, and the size of it
  * front use this first amount as starting point for the display (pipe it to a graph module)
  * at each new data the front add it to the display (one more point on the graph)
* user stop action
  * front send stop signal trough socket
  * front can : or store the actual dataset for the next time or delete the dataset.
  * back close the db channel, stop listening and sending.

* backend trigger the closing of all open channels at delog, 
  or after a certain amount of time whithout actions. Don't let a channel open if not necessary..

Should be quite fail permissive, it could even integrate a losed packets recovery system.
Just have to count what we send and receive, and when there is a difference, ask for what's missing.

Or a brute api call on user action and a refresh.



------------------

## Torrents manager.
Sort TV show by name when displaying. Then sort by season, then by episode. 
Recognize video file and subtitles files, delete nfo and others.


-----------------

##Create a user menu with: 

 * Log out
 * download all (videos/songs/note with checkboxes)
 * User stats
 * Learn more about the project.
